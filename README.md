# prompt-gate

![Status: WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-orange)

**Prompt Gate**

A lean gateway that screens résumés and manuscripts for prompt-injection **before** they hit your LLM—fast, quiet, and accurate. We combine Azure Prompt Shields, targeted heuristics, and open-source models to stop attacks.

> **Status:** Work in progress – core features sketched, implementation under way.  
> Not ready for production use.
